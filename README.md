# BusTracking 
## Description of Project
### This activity focuses on pulling in a map of Cambridge from MapBox and adding custom markers to it along the #1 bus route between Harvard and MIT. 
This was my first time working with an access Token and integrating the MapBox JS library.
## How to Run
### To run this activity, simply load the HTML file onto your browser. Click the button that shows the stops between MIT and Harvard. Make sure you have this loaded in a full browser window for optimal results.
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
### I would like to continute to add bus stops along the entire #1 bus route for the city of Boston. Then I would like to continue working to create stops along my commute to work.
